### Alternative Payment Methods
Alternative payment methods allow customers across the globe to pay with their bank accounts, wallets, and other local payment methods. Relevant alternative payment methods are automatically presented with Smart Payment Buttons.

For example, a customer in the Netherlands might want to pay using iDEAL, which is used by more than half of consumers in the Netherlands for online purchases, whereas a customer in Belgium on the same website might want to pay using Bancontact, a popular payment method there.

Alternative payments transactions display as PayPal transactions in your PayPal account. There is no difference between alternative payment transactions and PayPal transactions and you can issue refunds for these transactions.

### Standard Card Fields
Standard Card Fields intelligently present the most relevant credit card payment types to your buyers, automatically. This makes it easier for them to complete their purchase using methods like Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Maestro, and so on.

With Standard Card Fields, the card fields for the checkout flow display in-line beneath the Smart Payment Buttons when your buyer selects a credit card. Your buyers can conveniently and seamlessly pay with their credit card anywhere vertical Smart Payment Buttons display.
